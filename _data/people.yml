  about: I am a population biologist with interests at both the pure and applied ends of the spectrum. I follow an interdisciplinary approach, developing data-driven models to understand population dynamics and natural selection in laboratory and free-living populations. I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to shape selection on key ecological traits.

  roles: [PI, CI]
  about: I am studying how shifting environment conditions influence the patterns of species abundances over time. I am interested in understanding how predictions of future population abundances are complicated by the complex interplay of changes in multiple components of the environment and by predatory or competitive interactions between species. I am a strong advocate of data driven ecology, using models as a tool to quantify the processes underlying ecological systems.

  about: My research interests centre on sustainable agricultural practices and balancing food production with biodiversity conservation. Agricultural policy changes quickly, and the resulting changes to land-use patterns and land management practices can have wide-ranging ecological impacts. I believe strongly in the need to study, quantify and manage these impacts and the importance of knowledge exchange between science, policy makers and landowners.
