    <h3>Regression Tools</h3>
    <h4>BayesX</h4>
    <p>BayesX is a software tool for estimating structured additive regression models. Structured additive regression embraces several well-known regression models such as generalized additive models (GAM), generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), generalized geoadditive mixed models (GGAMM), dynamic models, varying coefficient models, and geographically weighted regression within a unifying framework. Besides exponential family regression, BayesX also supports non-standard regression situations such as regression for categorical responses, hazard regression for continuous survival times, continuous time multi-state models, quantile regression, distributional regression models and multilevel models.</p>
